### Ticketing
<dl>
	<dt>How do I get tickets?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
            When tickets become available you will see a <b>link on
            the <a href="tickets-and-donations.html">tickets and donations</a> page</b>. We
            don't release tickets until about a week before Halloween so if you can't see
            the link it's because we've not yet released the tickets.
        </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>How much do tickets cost?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
            Tickets are free, but we are collecting for Cancer Research UK and ask that
            those who can afford it make a donation either via the
            <a href="{{ site.donations-url }}">fundrasing page</a> or with cash
            on the night.
        </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>When are tickets released?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
            If you <a href="/mailing-list.html">join our mailing list</a>, we'll send you an email a few days before the
            release date and let you know when and where to get the tickets from.
        </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Can I change my ticket time?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
            There is no way to exchange tickets, but if your preferred time is still
            available, you can book new tickets and cancel the previous ones.
        </p>
