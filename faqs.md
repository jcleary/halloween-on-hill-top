### Ticketing
#### How do I get tickets?
When tickets become available you will see a **link on 
the <a href="tickets-and-donations.html">tickets and donations</a> page**. We 
don't release tickets until about a week before Halloween so if you can't see 
the link it's because we've not yet released the tickets.
<br/><br/>

#### How much do tickets cost?
Tickets are free, but we are collecting for Cancer Research UK and ask that
those who can afford it make a donation either via the 
<a href="{{ site.donations-url }}">fundrasing page</a> or with cash
on the night.
<br/><br/>

#### When are tickets released?
If you <a href="/mailing-list.html">join our mailing list</a>, we'll send you an email a few days before the 
release date and let you know when and where to get the tickets from.
<br/><br/>

#### Can I change my ticket time?
There is no way to *exchange* tickets, but if your preferred time is still
available, you can book new tickets and cancel the previous ones.
<br/><br/>

### General
#### What age group is the experience suitable for?
**11+ years**. Younger guests are welcome but may find it too frightening.
<br/><br/>

#### How long is the experience?
Around four minutes.
