#### How do I get tickets?
When tickets become available you will see a **link on 
the <a href="tickets-and-donations.html">tickets and donations</a> page**. We 
don't release tickets until about a week before Halloween so if you can't see 
the link it's because we've not yet released the tickets
<br/><br/>

#### How can I find out when the tickets are released?
If you **join our mailing list**, we'll send you an email a few days before the 
release date and let you know when and where to get the tickets from.
<br/><br/>

#### What are group is the experience suitable for?
**11+ years**. Younger guests are welcome but may find it too frightening.
