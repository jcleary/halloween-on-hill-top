This was our first ever Halloween scare experience, and whilst it may have lacked some 
of the pazzaz of later years, it was still pretty scary! When we started planning, we
realised that the side passageway of our house was all but built for Halloween; it's 
dark, narrow, and pretty claustrophobic. On top of that, there is a window followed by a 
door along the route - excellent for hiding in or showcasing ghoulish artifacts (as indeed
we did on the Jack The Ripper tour).

This tour was probably also our shortest tour, running at under two minutes. Guests were
guided along the passageway by JTR himself, who pointed out a partially dismembered corpse
through the window that had been set on a table. The tour then continued into the second
half of the passage where the sounds of a victorian street could be heard and culminated with 
an abandoned girl asking "have you seen my mummy?" and a woman's body hanging from a noose.
