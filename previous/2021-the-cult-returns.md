Many ideas were thrown around this year, including, but not limited to "Ghost Clowns". However we finally settled on 
a Cult theme. The story goes like this:

<blockquote>
  in the early 1960s a mysterious pattern of missing person reports emerged, centering in the Cheadle Hulme area. 
  Police raided a vicarage that had supposedly stood empty for years. Investigators searching the building uncovered 
  evidence of terrifying rituals and human sacrifice.  A cult, 'The Endless Divinity of Baphomet' had been operating 
  undetected from the vicarage for months.  Realising that the police were about to expose them, the cult had fled. 
  Sixty years on, come on a tour with us and let us show you what the cult left behind!!
</blockquote>

Our guides took the guests around the house, commenting on various artifacts left behind by the cult. Then, after 
hearing some doors banging inside the house, our guides take the group on a detour only to be confronted by over a 
dozen cult members and the cult leader (aka Baphomet) who chase after the group and trap them into a smaller room. 
The lights then trip out, plunging our guests into darkness.

Baphomet speaks to the group (who, remember, are still in darkness) inviting them to witness the sacrifice. The doors 
in front of them are flung open to reveal the cult members and their leader preparing the sacrifice. Baphomet then 
chases the group out through the front door.
