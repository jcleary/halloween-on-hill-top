Obviously Covid has stopped some of our scary plans by limiting what we can do. Because of this, unsurprisingly 
there won’t be a Halloween tour this year. However, we’re not going to let a pandemic spoil everything!

For 2020 we’ve decided instead to decorate the outside of our house, in aid of Cancer Research UK. Come and walk 
past (socially distanced, of course) and see what we’ve been up to!
