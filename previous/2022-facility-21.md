    Welcome to Clearskies, a laboratory established in 1922. We employ state of the art technology and world class scientific minds to create a future where there is no more disease.  This is achieved through safe experiments on willing, human volunteers. Volunteers that share our aspirations. We are proud to say that we are well on the way to eradicating some of the world’s major diseases.

    Each month, randomly selected members of the public are invited to inspect our facilities, in line with government protocol. We trust that you will find your tour of our high tech laboratories informative and that you will be impressed by how hard the Clearskies team strive to achieve, perform and deliver.

Over 400 visitors took our 'Facility 21’ Halloween tour. The event involved 20 wonderful helpers - our 'Team Halloween’, and ran over two nights. Scientist Alun took groups around ‘Clearskies Pharmaceuticals', a laboratory which used human volunteers to test on and find cures for well known diseases. The government had reason to believe that Clearskies Pharmaceuticals were severely mistreating their volunteers, so has asked groups to tour the building and report back what they saw.

We raised £1,300 for Cancer Research UK and are so grateful to all those people who braved both the weather AND our tour!!
