The Cleary family have been running spooky tours at Halloween for the past six years, from our home in Cheadle Hulme. 
Our son, Jack, first had the idea of running tours after we all visited Salem, Massachusetts at Halloween. The houses 
in Salem were decorated so fantastically and many residents dressed up and greeted trick or treaters on their porches. 
Jack decided that we could give trick or treaters a Halloween ‘experience’ back in the UK! Our first experience, 
"Jack the Ripper", was born in 2016! Since then we've got more adventurous with our tour themes. We start planning 
for each tour in July and for the past couple of years we've collect for a charity close to many peoples’ hearts, 
Cancer Research UK.

Our 2019 ’Zombie Apocalypse...2 Years Later' tour took 200 trick or treaters on a terrifying six minute adventure 
around a 'safe house', encountering numerous zombies on the way.  Visitors encountered a horrifying, chainsaw-wielding 
maniac, half human and half zombie, and a stooge planted in the touring group was dragged away by a flesh-hungry zombie.  2019 also saw the birth of our online booking system, as some visitors to our 2018 Paranormal Experience had queued for an hour in the rain!

Our ‘The Devil Worshipper’s Daughter’ tour in 2018 saw paranormal investigators encounter a great deal of ghostly 
activity!! In 2020, our 'Haunted Graveyard' invited visitors to take a socially distanced look whilst our 
family of gravediggers chatted to them from 6ft away. Despite Covid, we raised over £850 for Cancer Research UK.

We are so grateful to our "Team Halloween" - our fantastic live actors - for all their help, enthusiasm and 
professionalism!
