# Facility 21  
<blockquote>
    
    Welcome to Clearskies, a laboratory established in 1922. We employ state of the art technology and world class scientific minds to create a future where there is no more disease.  This is achieved through safe experiments on willing, human volunteers. Volunteers that share our aspirations. We are proud to say that we are well on the way to eradicating some of the worldâ€™s major diseases.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    
    Each month, randomly selected members of the public are invited to inspect our facilities, in line with government protocol. We trust that you will find your tour of our high tech laboratories informative and that you will be impressed by how hard the Clearskies team strive to achieve, perform and deliver.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Together we look towards a disease-free future for mankind.
