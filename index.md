Thanks to everyone who came this year - hope you enjoyed the event as much as we did. Our team
get a real kick about hearing your feedback, so if you have any comments or feedback please
add it to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HalloweenOnHillTop/posts/3034946050108918">this post</a> on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HalloweenOnHillTop">Facebook page</a>.

We'll keep the <a href="{{ site.donations-url }}">donations page</a> open for a few 
more weeks just in case, but to date we have collected **just over £1,200** for Cancer Research UK 👏👏

And remember to **get your name on our <a href="{% link mailing-list.md %}">mailing list</a>** so we can let you
know when tickets are made available.

See y'all in 2022!
